# Post-JEE-Services

I decided to build this project after my JEE Adv. exam got over I had have all the time in the world, and at the same time I started searching for colleges which i was get according to my JEE Mains rank.
I found many platforms which was healping us find our one institute but they were doing all things by their own (Imean on pen and paper), so I made this Application to make our search for college easier. While making this added 
some more features such as suggesting movies and some more stufs.
